The beginning of the Konik library project.


The goal of the library is to provide an easy way to create, read, and validate ZUGFeRD invoices. 
Our vision is to provide the #1 library resource for every application that deals with reading and writing ZUGFeRD invoices.

Moreover, I hope that with the Konik library, the ZUGFeRD standard will continue to gain momentum, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. 
Further development of this highly useful library will be influenced by increased adoption of the ZUGFeRD standard, as well as user input.
