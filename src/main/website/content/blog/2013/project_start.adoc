The beginning of the konik library project.


The goal of the library is to provide an easy way to create, read and validate ZUGFeRD invoices. 
The vision is to provide the #1 library for every application reading and writing ZUGFeRD invoices.

Moreover I hope that with the Konik library the ZUGFeRD standard will gain momentum especially in the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. 
The further development of this library will be influenced by the ZUGFeRD adoption and user input.
