The Konik library is approaching the 1.0 release in big steps. Just in time with the official ZUGFeRD announcement we finished our 0.5.0 release.
This is the in between release and does not yet support all 1.0 ZUGFeRD features. 

=== Release Notes

The Konik domain model can be considered stable. For the final 1.0 release we are planning to extend the model without breaking the 
existing API.


A +zip+ https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/konik/distribution/0.5.0/distribution-0.5.0.zip[distribution package^, role="download-zip-package"]
