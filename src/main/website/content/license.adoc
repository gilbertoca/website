== FOSS License Exception

I want people to be able to build Free/Libre and Open Source Software (“FLOSS”) applications using the Konik library 
despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License  (the “AGPLv3”).

=== Terms and Conditions

Definitions::
- Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the AGPLv3.
- “Derivative Work” means derivative works as defined under applicable copyright law.

Additional Grants::
As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the AGPL:
You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Konik library and one or more works 
(each, a “FLOSS Work”) licensed under one or more of the licenses listed on {1}[Open Source Initiative], as long as:

* You obey the AGPLv3 in all respects for the Konik library and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the 
	Derivative Work which are not derived from the Konik library, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate 
	works in themselves

* You distribute Derivative Works in object code or executable form with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code 
	on the same medium and under the same FOSS license applying to the object code or executable forms;
		
* The Derivative Work can reasonably be considered independent and separate work that is intended for use by end-users 
	and not as a library for software development purposes.

This Exception can in no way be considered to grant rights to use or distribute the Konik library under any license other than the 
AGPLv3. If you fail to comply with all of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are void and your rights 
immediately revert back to those granted in the AGPLv3.
