== Source Code
The konik.io source code is hosted on github. 

https://github.com/konik-io/

== First Steps

Before you start make sure that http://maven.apache.org[Maven] and http://git-scm.com/[Git] are installed and working on your computer.

Check out the source code to a directory of your choice. We use +konik.io+ as a default example. 
[source,bash] 
	> git clone https://github.com/konik-io/barn barn

Next Step will build the Konik library and run the tests.

[source,bash]
----
	> cd barn
	> mvn install
----

Now you should take you favorite IDE and import the project.

=== Get to know the data model

Make yourself familiar with the ZUGFeRD Standard. Read first the link:/docs/index.html#data_model[konik documentation] and download the the http://www.ferd-net.de/front_content.php?idart=865[ZUGFeRD info package] for reference.
